by Elena Carey

## Description

A merging of MYSQL, MYSQL2, Inquirer, and Javascript, Trackr is designed to allow employers to keep track of their departments. It allows employers to hold data about their employees and their salary information.

## Usage

This program will allow a user to create a list of Job Departments, Roles, and Employees. It allows for editing of the employee's manager and job role. Future developments will allow for object deletion, searching by specified criteria, and giving an account of expenditures for the company.
